        <p id="career">With an M.Sc. in Geology, coupled with expertise in HTML, CSS,
         JavaScript, TypeScript, and Next.js, along with teaching experience in 
         Mathematics, I am well-positioned for diverse career opportunities. I can 
         pursue roles as a Front-End or Full-Stack Developer, leveraging my coding 
         skills to build dynamic, responsive websites and applications. My background 
         in teaching mathematics also opens doors in EdTech, where I can create 
         educational content or teach coding and algorithm development. Additionally, 
         I can explore niche fields such as GeoTech or geology data analysis, 
         combining my geology knowledge with web development to build or manage 
         platforms for geological data visualization. Freelancing is another viable 
         option, allowing me to offer web development services or tutor students in 
         mathematics and coding. This unique combination of skills positions me to 
         thrive in both technical and educational sectors.</p>
